Iterator:
Sets like HashSet, LinkedHashset and TreeSet don't allow duplicate values. There are three main types of Sets.
HashSet:
    Upside: Fast
    Downside: Does not retain the insertion order
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Retains the insertion order
    Downside: It's slower than HashSet.
TreeSet:
    Upside: It keeps the data sorted
    Downside: It's the slowest.
