Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions we can
    compare things if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical operators.
Arithmetic operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like addition, subtraction etc.
    + ==> Addition
    - ==> Subtraction
    / ==> Division
    * ==> Multiplication
    % ==> Modulus, remainder

Relational operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. For example if something is bigger than
    other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
    == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not, if the same we get true otherwise we get false.
    != => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value, we get true if they are the same.
    >  => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get true.
    <  => used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right we will get true.
    >= => if the value on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are the same we will get a true.
    <= => it's opposite of >= and it is used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing.
Conditional constructs
    Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that executes based on a condition, if condition is true then java
    executes the code otherwise it skips that code.
    How to write IfElse conditions:
    if(condition){
    any line of code

    if(){
    }

    }

Important Notes:
    1) For String we use equals method instead of === sign because it's a non-primitive data type.
    2) We can can cmd+opt+l (Mac) ctrl+alt+l (Windows) to format code.
    3) If we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.

If else conditions
    If I have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use If else if
    If I have multiple conditions and thse conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions
