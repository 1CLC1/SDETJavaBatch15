OOP(Object oriented programming):
    It's just a way of writing code that follows certain rules or guidelines. We create classes that have
    attributes/properties/fields and methods/function/behaviourism.
Why should we learn OOP?
    1) It simplifies the software development and maintenance
        (adding new features changing and existing code).
    2) Code duplication is reduced.
    3) It also helps us represent something from real life with the help of classes
       and objects.
Class:
    Is a blueprint or a design from which actual real-life objects are created. Computer uses a class to check what that class can do
    Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in) Here Scanner is class. scan is an object of scanner class. With the help of object we can
    use the methods from a class we can also use properties from that class.
