Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions. They only
    work with boolean (true and false) values. There are three Logical Operators
    1) !, ||, &&
Why should we use Logical Operators:
    1) They can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.
NOT(!):
    It reverses the conditions. If something is true it will make it false
    and if something is false it will make it true.
    System.out.printIn(!true) =>  false
Logical Or Operator (||);
    It can combine two or more than two conditions and returns true as long as there is one
    condition is true. If all the conditions become false it returns us a false.
Logical AND(&&):
    It can also combine two or more conditions. It only returns true if all the conditions
    are true.
